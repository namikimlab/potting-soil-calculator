# ðŸŒ± Potting Soil Volume Calculator
> A practical soil calculator built with React, TypeScript, and Vite â€” fast, mobile-friendly, SEO-ready, and designed like a real product.

This calculates the right amount of soil based on your plant pot's shape and size.

## Why This Project?
I created this calculator as a practical tool for beginner gardeners and to showcase my full ownership of a production-ready frontend tool â€” from UX to deployment and SEO.

- user input validation
- domain logic (geometry, volume calculation)
- product recommendation logic
- mobile-first design, SEO, analytics ready
